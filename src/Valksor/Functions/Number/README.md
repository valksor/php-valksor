# Valksor Functions: Number

A PHP library providing various number-related functions including prime number checking, distance calculations, and mathematical operations.

## Installation

Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require valksor/php-functions-number
```

## Requirements

PHP 8.4 or higher

### Optional Extensions

- **ext-gmp**: The GNU Multiple Precision (GMP) extension is recommended for efficient prime number checking, especially for large numbers. The package will use alternative algorithms if GMP is not available, but GMP provides better performance for prime number operations.

## Usage

There are two ways to use this package: via the Functions class or by directly using the traits.

### Using the Functions Class

The Functions class provides various number-related functions for mathematical operations and checks.

```php
use Valksor\Functions\Number\Functions;

// Create a new Functions instance
$number = new Functions();

// Check if a number is prime
$isPrime = $number->isPrime(17);

// Calculate distance between two geographical points
$distance = $number->distanceBetweenPoints(
    40.7128, -74.0060,  // New York (latitude, longitude)
    34.0522, -118.2437, // Los Angeles (latitude, longitude)
    true,               // Return distance in kilometers
    2                   // Precision (decimal places)
);

// Calculate greatest common divisor
$gcd = $number->greatestCommonDivisor(48, 18);

// Calculate least common multiple
$lcm = $number->leastCommonMultiple(12, 15);

// Check if a value is an integer
$isInt = $number->isInt('123');

// Check if a value is a float
$isFloat = $number->isFloat('123.45');

// Swap two numbers
[$a, $b] = $number->swap(5, 10);
```

### Using Traits Directly

Alternatively, you can use the traits directly in your own classes:

```php
use Valksor\Functions\Number\Traits\_IsPrime;
use Valksor\Functions\Number\Traits\_DistanceBetweenPoints;
use Valksor\Functions\Number\Traits\_GreatestCommonDiviser;

class MyClass
{
    // Import the traits you need
    use _IsPrime;
    use _DistanceBetweenPoints;
    use _GreatestCommonDiviser;

    public function doSomething(): void
    {
        // Use the methods directly
        $isPrime = $this->isPrime(17);
        $distance = $this->distanceBetweenPoints(40.7128, -74.0060, 34.0522, -118.2437);
        $gcd = $this->greatestCommonDivisor(48, 18);
    }
}
```

Note that some traits may depend on other helper traits. For example, the `_IsPrime` trait uses `_IsPrimal`, `_IsPrimeBelow1000`, and `_IsPrimeGmp` internally. The Functions class handles these dependencies for you, but if you use the traits directly, you may need to include these helper traits as well.
